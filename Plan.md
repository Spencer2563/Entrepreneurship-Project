# Brainstorm/Compare and Contrast
| App Ideas    |  What this would look like |
| -------- | ------- |
| Time Management app (Scheduler/planner)  | This would be an app that allows people to input their daily tasks, mark them as done, or set a due date on said task. Additionally, I would like to see a study mode button in the app that puts up a timer that says how long to study then goes off and sets a timer for a 5 or 10 min break before going back to the study timer.    |
| Meditation app  | This app would lead you through guided meditation, with relaxing music and a soothing voice instructing you on how to achieve total bliss.      |
| Senior Citizen Help app  | Not entirely sure    |

### What do we like
<strong> Spencer</strong>: I like the Idea of the time management app and I believe the meditation app holds potential to be an app that could garner attention in a presentational sense. My two cents is, that I believe the best idea is to offer an app that focuses on both mental health through meditation and relaxation and helps you manage daily tasks, a self-help app if you will. As for the senior citizen app, I do not have enough information at this time to decide if I am for or against the idea.
