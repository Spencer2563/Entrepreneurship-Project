# Brainstorm/Compare and Contrast
| App Ideas    |  What this would look like |
| -------- | ------- |
| Time Management app (Scheduler/planner)  | This would be an app that allows people to input their daily tasks, mark them as done, or set a due date on said task. Additionally, I would like to see a study mode button in the app that puts up a timer that says how long to study then goes off and sets a timer for a 5 or 10 min break before going back to the study timer.    |
| Meditation app  | This app would lead you through guided meditation, with relaxing music and a soothing voice instructing you on how to achieve total bliss.      |
| Senior Citizen Help app  | Not entirely sure    |

### What do we like
<strong> Spencer</strong>: I like the Idea of the time management app and I believe the meditation app holds potential to be an app that could garner attention in a presentational sense. My two cents is, that I believe the best idea is to offer an app that focuses on both mental health through meditation and relaxation and helps you manage daily tasks, a self-help app if you will. As for the senior citizen app, I do not have enough information at this time to decide if I am for or against the idea.

## How should the app be made
Considering that our app will need graphics and is expected to run on a mobile device, we currently plan to use MIT App Inventor. MIT App inventor will allow us to quickly produce a prototype of the app to present to the class at the end of the alloted time for this project. If we choose to continue this project further, it would be smart to seek outside help in order to have a better final product, and more creative freedom, with an app unrestricted by MIT App Inventors limitations.

# How do we plan to document our daily productivity?
We currently have a backlog where we can create tasks that need to be completed every day we will add tasks and work on them. At the end of each development day we will submit a pull request linked to each corrresponding task. On this pull request we will write a quick reflection on the work we did today and any important notes or insights to where development is headed. When this pull request is merged the corresponding task will auto update to completed. Additionally we plan to keep a folder that will house photos of the app to show the progression of development and where it started and ended.
